Chrome extension offering quality of life updates to fishtank.live (Season 3) with a focus on dedicated 24/7 streaming devices. The goal of this extension is to eliminate any form of user interaction by automatically closing modals, auto switching to director cam, etc. so I can avoid having to plug in a mouse to my Raspberry Pi every time a modal gets pushed out or the director cam gets out of sync.

## Features
These settings can all be toggled in the options for the Chrome extension.

- auto close modals
- auto close toasts
- enable f key shortcut for full screen

## To Do
- auto follow most viewed room when director mode is offline
- enable m key shortcut for mute
